# Reinforcement-Learning-Unity-ML-Engine
Playground for exploring RL algorithms with the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents).


## Project: Minion Navigation with DQN ([more details](https://github.com/PrajishKumar/Reinforcement-Learning-Unity-ML-Engine/tree/main/minion_navigation))

Performance of the agent after training to pick only the yellow bananas:

## Project: Arm Reacher with DDPG ([more details](https://github.com/PrajishKumar/Reinforcement-Learning-Unity-ML-Engine/tree/main/arm_reacher))

Performance of the agent (robotic arm) after training to track the moving green targets:

## Project: Collaborative Tennis with MADDPG ([more details](https://github.com/PrajishKumar/Reinforcement-Learning-Unity-ML-Engine/tree/main/collaborative_tennis))

Performance of the agents (tennis rackets) after training to keep passing the ball to each other without dropping.
